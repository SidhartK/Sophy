# Sophy

Sophy is the interface for people who have a bunch of shit to do in possibly different realms who find themselves in a frozen state due to the overwhelming nature of the number of tasks. Imagine a scenario where a college student sits down to write an essay but while writing the user is constantly distracted by the fact that they need to finish a tax form, pick up groceries and solve a problem on a math homework.

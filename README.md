# Sophy

Sophy is the interface for people who have a bunch of shit to do in possibly different realms who find themselves in a frozen state due to the overwhelming nature of the number of tasks. Imagine a scenario where a college student sits down to write an essay but while writing the user is constantly distracted by the fact that they need to finish a tax form, pick up groceries and solve a problem on a math homework. 

## Assumptions

The user will be able to input tasks into Sophy. It is assumed that with minimal effort the user cdan possibly tag these tasks with various attributes (e.g. chore, homework, night-task, etc.). As soon as the user logs these tasks, the goal is that they completely forget about them and move on with their day. 

Then at a later point when the user enters a work period, they go to Sophy who will then recommend tasks to the user.
